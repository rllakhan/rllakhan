## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Ram Lakhan, a pre-final year Computer Science student with a strong focus on Android app development. Over the course of my learning journey, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects using both Java and Kotlin, which has greatly enhanced my skills in Android development. These projects have given me hands-on experience in building apps, designing user-friendly interfaces, and optimizing app performance.

Through these practical experiences, I've become proficient in core Android concepts such as Activities, Fragments, RecyclerViews, and data persistence with SQLite. I'm constantly refining my skills and learning new tools and techniques to stay up-to-date with the evolving Android ecosystem.
